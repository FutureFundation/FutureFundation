        <p>The moment now is very important and can determinate our future. We must deccarbonize the grid with renewables sources: solar, wind. Probably around 2040 we´re going to max out with renewables and we won´t be able to decarbonize futher. We´re going to need another zero-carbon option.</p>

        <p>Fusion, if we can get it going fast enough, will play a unique role in pushing us toward decarbonization. Fundamentally, what fusion is, is trying to put a star in a bottle, and tokamak is baically the simplest type of bottle, and in this case, is a magnet that holds plasma inside of it, and it insulates the fuel, the plasma, so it can get very, very, very hot.  </p>

        <p>Fusion energy is basically the universe´s choice for how it generates energy. </p>

        <p>The reason we don´t have fusion power plants rigth now today, was largely one of scale. The mission of M.I.T is to show that you can make net energy from fusion. If you want to hold something at very high temperatures, but you can´t use a physical object to hold it, then you need a force at a distance. And this is essentially what the magnetic field does. </p>

        <p>We embled it in a magnetic field, so these very, very, very hot particles cannot escape, and the you put it in the rigth configuration, and then it gets hot enough for those conditions to occour. </p>

        <img src="./sparc_lab.PNG" alt="sparc_lab">

        <p>M.I.T doubled the field o three years, "the new magnet technology allows us to make fusion so much smaller with known science, that we are going to able to get there so much sooner than people has thought previously possible." </p>
        <p>The magnet was the hardest part to do, now everything is going o be faster. </p>
