        <p>The moment now is very important and can determinate our future. We must deccarbonize the grid with renewables sources: solar, wind. Probably around 2040 we´re going to max out with renewables and we won´t be able to decarbonize futher. We´re going to need another zero-carbon option.</p>

        <p>Fusion, if we can get it going fast enough, will play a unique role in pushing us toward decarbonization. Fundamentally, what fusion is, is trying to put a star in a bottle, and tokamak is baically the simplest type of bottle, and in this case, is a magnet that holds plasma inside of it, and it insulates the fuel, the plasma, so it can get very, very, very hot.  </p>
