And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.”"</p>

            <p>"God, when You sent Your Son to Earth, You showed me what love looks like. Even after Jesus returned to
                heaven, Your Holy Spirit continues to demonstrate that Your love remains. Because of that, I can abide
                in Your presence, hold onto hope, and root my faith in You. All because You love me. Thank You! Today, I
                choose to worship You. In Jesus’ name, Amen."</p>
