            <h1>It´s well with my soul</h1>

            <h3>writer: Horatio Spafford / composed by: Philip Bliss</h3>

        </header>

        <p>When peace like a river, attendeth my way,
            When sorrows like sea billows roll;
            Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to know
            It is well, it is well, with my soul.</p>

        <p>Refrain
            It is well, (it is well),
            With my soul, (with my soul)
            It is well, it is well, with my soul.</p>

        <p>Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
            Let this blest assurance control,
            That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
            And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</p>

        <p>My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
            My sin, not in part but the whole,
            Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
            Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!</p>

        <p>For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
            If Jordan above me shall roll,
            No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life,
            Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul</p>
        
        <p>But Lord, 'tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
            The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
            Oh, trump of the angel! Oh, voice of the Lord!
            Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul.
            </p>

        <p> And Lord, haste the day when the faith shall be sight,
            The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
            The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
            A song in the night, oh my soul!
        </p>
