        <header><h1>Foundation Trilogy - By Isaac Asimov</h1>
        <h2>writer: Daniel Matos</h2></header>

        <p>The Foundation  Trilogy is by far the most epic book that i ever read. It started to be written in 1942, and still very popular among the sci-fi fans. This series is the winner of the Special Hugo Prize. The prize was promoting the best sci-fi an fantasy series of all the time, and the Foundation Trilogy win, even the Lord of the Rigns can´t take this prize.</p>

        <p>In almost 20.000 years after, the humankind conquerer all the star and the planets of the universe. And everything that exists is under control of the Galact Empire, and it´s capital is Trantor, in the center of the galaxy. The, a psycho-history named Seldon discovered, by the math and psicology, that this great empire will fall about 300 years. Then he begun to study how to avoid this, and he founded the foundation, a planet with a lot of scientists that will write an enciclopédia that will decrease the time of darkness and of pain, all through knowledge.</p>

        <p>Through the trilogy we see how the humankind respond at some questions, like the centralization of the empire, the fall, etc. This series is based on the Roman history.</p>

        <p>And all the universe, the diplomatic questions, the respond of classes, is much interesting. And we see how the reaction of masses can be easy calculated, Seldon is died in the second chapter of the first book, but he really saw everything that would happen, and his presence is constant in the hole series.</p>

        <p>I really love geopilitics and study the great empires. This book is all this, but in 20.000 years after. We can see that everything, even the most constant thing can change, like a pretty big state. This book is a review about the human ways of action, about the burocracy, about history, and about atomic power. Just as in I, Robot Asimov shows all his deep knowledge about almost everything, since atomic energy, to rocket science, to neural activity.</p>

        <p>I really don´t like a lot the third book, specially the plot-twists, but all the concept and the universe that Asimov created is amazing, the planets, the mitology, the equipament, the calculas that is made to travel through the hiperspace. This is probably the best thing in Asimov, all that he write about technology and space travel is real science, he always studied a lot before write about something.</p>

        <p>In my opinion The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is the best sci-fi series, but i don´t read all the Asimov series yet, i´m exited to read the robot series, but Foundation wins 5 stars.</p>
